# 🏠 PG Hostel Data Analysis via Web Scraping (Python)

This project showcases a practical implementation of **web scraping** and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to examine the pricing, location distribution, and features of PG (Paying Guest) hostels. Using Python, we scrape hostel listing websites to collect real-time data, clean and structure it, and then analyze it for actionable insights.

## 📁 File Included
- `Eda analysis on Pg_hostels(webscrapping project)...ipynb`:  
  A step-by-step Jupyter Notebook demonstrating:
  - Web scraping using BeautifulSoup/requests
  - Extraction of hostel data (price, location, amenities, etc.)
  - Data cleaning and wrangling
  - Visual EDA using charts, maps, and correlations

## 🔍 Project Highlights
- **Live data scraping** from PG listing platforms
- **Location-wise hostel pricing analysis**
- **Top areas with affordable or premium PG options**
- **Comparison of amenities like AC, Wi-Fi, meals, etc.**
- **Bar graphs, histograms, and pie charts** for clear insights
